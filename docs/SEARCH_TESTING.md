   - Verify results are found and highlighted
   - Check that the results counter shows the number of matches

3. **Test navigation**:
   - Use Next/Previous buttons to navigate between results
   - Verify the page changes when results are on different pages
   - Test F3/Shift+F3 keyboard shortcuts

4. **Test edge cases**:
   - Search for non-existent text (should show "No results")
   - Search for common words like "the", "and", etc.
   - Test case-insensitive search
